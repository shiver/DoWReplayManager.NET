DoWReplayManager.NET
====================

This is/was a replay manager for the original Dawn of War RTS game.

It was my first successful public project which saw in excess of 10k downloads (decent for back in 2004-2005 ^_^). I was hooked on coding before, but this project strengthened my resolve to make development my career, rather than a hobby.

Disclaimer:
I have not worked on this project since around 2005, but wanted to preserve its memory for both myself and anyone else who might find it interesting. I haven't touched the code, attempted to compile it or even open it in Visual Studio since that time. So don't expect too much.
